3.3.3 Attendance, acceptability, and personal
practice
Because the sessions were regularly scheduled in the curriculum dur-
ing the academic schedule, there was a high attendance rate for both
programs. For the mindfulness intervention group, 50% of children
attended all mindfulness sessions, 33% missed one session, 12% missed
two sessions, and 5% missed three sessions. For the active control
group (SFL), 67% of children attended all SFL sessions, 22% missed
one session, 5% missed two sessions, and 5% missed three sessions.
There were no differences in the attendance rate between groups
(t(41)=−1.160, p=0.253). The acceptability was high in both the
mindfulness group ( M=8.45, SD=2.78), and the active control group
(M=8.54, SD=2.63). Also, personal practice was moderately high in
the mindfulness group ( M=6.69, SD=3.95), and the control group
(M=7.04, SD=3.40). There were no differences between groups
in acceptability ( t(44)=−0.109, p=0.914) and personal practice
(t(42)=−0.328, p=0.744).
4 DISCUSSION
In this study, we examined the effects of a mindfulness-based inter-
vention in children in a high-risk context on inhibitory control and
its underlying neural mechanisms. Compared to an active control
group, children that received the MBI showed less error rates in the
Go/Nogo task for all trial types. No differences in reaction times
were found between groups. Additionally, children in the mindfulness
group showed increased EC, global EFs, emotion and behavioral regu-
lation after the intervention, evidenced by child self-report and teacher
reports. Furthermore, EEG results revealed significant differences in
the P3 amplitude; with children in the mindfulness group showing an
increased Nogo-P3 amplitude and children in the control group show-
ing a slight decrease in P3 amplitude over time. Taken together, thisis one of the first studies to provide empirical evidence that an MBI
in a vulnerable school context increases children’s EFs, attention, and
inhibitory control. Importantly, the effects were evidenced by both
behavioral and neural indices, showing that frontocentral P3 amplitude
may underlie this effect. Following recent recommendations (Felver
et al., 2015 ), the use of an active control group allowed us to better con-
trol for non-specific effects and particularly, this study used as an active
control a very well evaluated social skills intervention that is widely
used in vulnerable schools in Chile, making it a very strict comparison.
Behaviorally, children that participated in the MBI showed a gen-
eral lower error rate in the Go/Nogo task compared to control children.
Interestingly, this was true for all task trials and times, including pre-
test. The Go/Nogo task we used (Albert et al., 2013 ) allowed us to
analyze attention-related effects with frequent versus infrequent go
trials and inhibition-related effects with infrequent go trials versus
nogo trials (infrequent go and nogo trials have the same proportion).
As the effects were observed in all task trials, this result may reflect
increased global attention rather than a specific effect of inhibitory
control. This result is very interesting since previous evidence shows
that mindfulness trains attention in adults but also in children (Zen-
ner et al., 2014 ) and attention is entirely associated with executive
functioning (Checa et al., 2014 ; Diamond, 2013 ). Moreover, according
to child self-report questionnaires EC (which include attentional con-
trol) increased in the mindfulness group over time compared to control
group, which is in line with behavioral task interpretation of results.
However, it cannot be stated that it is a consequence of the interven-
tion per se, since there was an overall group effect and there were
previous differences between groups in the case of frequent-go errors.
Regarding EEG results, we expected increased amplitudes of P3 in
the mindfulness group over time, particularly in Nogo-P3 which has
been proposed as a reliable neural index of motor inhibition (Albert
et al., 2013 ; Dykstra et al., 2020 ; Sánchez-Carmona et al., 2016 ;W e s -
sel & Aron, 2015 ). Our electrophysiological results closely matched the
behavioral results: children in the mindfulness training group showed
