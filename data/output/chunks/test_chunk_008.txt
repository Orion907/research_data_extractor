data ( χ2 [769]=13,548, p=1.000) and for teacher reports data ( χ2
[1749]=6370, p=1.000), indicating that the missing data did not show
a significant pattern and we could consider that data were missing at
random.
We examined the baseline differences between groups (i.e., mind-
fulness and control group) for dependent variables of children’s self-
reports and teachers’ reports by t-test. Repeated-measures ANOVAs
were used with Group (mindfulness vs. active control group) and Time
(pre, post) in all analyses as factors. The Greenhouse–Geisser (GG)
epsilon correction was applied to adjust the degrees of freedom of the
F ratios where necessary, and post hoc comparisons were also made in
order to determine the significance of pair-wise contrasts applying the
Bonferroni procedure (alpha 0.05). For all analyses, the level of signifi-
cance employed was 0.05. Effect sizes were computed using the partial
eta-square ( ƞ2p). For interpreting effect sizes, Cohen’s ( 1988 ) cutoff
criteria were followed: ƞ2p=0.01 as small effect size, ƞ2p=0.06 as
medium effect size, and ƞ2p=0.14 as large effect size.
3 RESULTS
3.1 ERP data
The ICA applied on the previous computed ERPs revealed a fronto-
central P3 component between 377 and 434 ms after stimulus onset.Figure 2shows its topography and waveforms for both times and
groups and all different trials of the Go/Nogo task. No significant
baseline difference in Nogo P3 amplitude was found ( t(44)=0.757,
p=0.453). A 2 ×2 ANOVA with factors of Time (pre, post) and Group
(mindfulness group, active control group) assessed possible changes
across time in mean amplitudes of the frontocentral P3 on Nogo tri-
als (Figure 2). There was a marginally significant main effect of time
(F(1, 44)=4.176, p=0.047, ƞ2p=0.087), and no significant main effect
of group ( F(1, 44)=0.141, p=0.709). Importantly, the time-by-group
interaction was significant ( F(1, 44)=5.287, p=0.026, ƞ2p=0.107).
Results showed an important increment of the Nogo-P3 amplitude in
the mindfulness group over time, and a slight decrease from pre to
post in the active control group. No other significant interactions were
found (Figure 2).
3.2 Behavioral data
Performance on the Go/Nogo task is shown in Table 2. For the Go trials
(frequent and infrequent-go), it shows means of error rates (omission
errors in percentages), and means RTs. For the Nogo trials, it shows
means of error rates (commission errors in percentage). Preliminary
analyses were conducted to examine pre-intervention group differ-
ences in behavioral data. There were no significant pre-intervention
group differences in error rates and RTs (all p>0.05), except for errors
