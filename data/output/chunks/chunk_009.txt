in frequent-go trials ( t(44)=2.219, p=0.032), where the control group
showed higher error rate.
With respect to percentage error rates, a significant main effect
of trial type was observed ( F(2,88)=379.6, p<0.001, ƞ2p=0.896).
Percentage error rates were higher for Nogo trials (i.e., commis-
sion errors) than for frequent- and infrequent- Go trials (omis-
sion errors), as expected. Also, group difference ( F(1,44)=4.356,
p=0.043, ƞ2p=0.09) and time-by-trial type interaction were sig-
nificant ( F(2,88)=10.712, p<0.001, ƞ2p=0.196), indicated higher
error rates among students in the active control group compared
to students in the mindfulness group. Moreover, the analysis indi-
cated that students in both groups improved their performance,
particularly with regard to commission errors within time. No other
significant effects or interactions were found regarding to error
rates.
Regarding RTs, a significant main effect of Go-trial type (frequent
and infrequent) was found ( F(1,44)=9.277, p=0.004, ƞ2p=0.174).
In general, correct responses to infrequent-go trials were larger
(higher reaction times) than correct responses to frequent-go trials
(slower reaction times). Additionally, a main effect of Time was found
(F(1,44)=20.9, p<0.001, ƞ2p=0.322), showing a general decrease in
frequent- and infrequent-go RTs at post-test compared to pre-test. No
other significant effect or interaction was found.
In summary, the mindfulness group, relative to the active control
group, did not change after the intervention in the reaction times in the
Go trials. However, in general, the percentage of errors in the control
group was higher than in the mindfulness group.
3.3 Questionnaires
3.3.1 Baseline comparisons
Preliminary analyses were conducted to examine pre-intervention
group differences across gender, age, and all of the dependent vari-
ables in the study. There were no significant group differences atbaseline on socio-demographic characteristics: gender ( χ2 [1]=0.006,
p=0.936), and age ( t(44)=0.903, p=0.371). There were no significant
pre-intervention group differences in children’s self-reports on mind-
fulness ( t(43)=0.007, p=0.994) and effortful control ( t(44)=1.462,
p=0.151). There were no significant pre-intervention group dif-
ferences on teacherst’ reports of children’s EF as assessed via the
BRIEF Global Index ( t(41)=0.697, p=0.489), behavioral regula-
tion ( t(41)=1.314, p=0.196), cognitive regulation ( t(41)=−0.496,
p=0.623) and emotion regulation indexes ( t(41)=1.120, p=0.269).
3.3.2 Intervention effects
Pretest and posttest means and standard deviations as well as differ-
ences in change scores for all dependent variables (i.e., mindfulness, EC,
EF, behavioral regulation, emotion regulation, and cognitive regulation)
by intervention group are reported in Table 3.
With regard to child self-reports, the results for mindfulness indi-
cated a significant change from pretest to posttest, F(1, 43)=5.101,
p=0.029, ƞ2p=0.11, indicating differences between the mindfulness
and control group, with a decrease in mindfulness scores in the control
group. Also, the results regarding EC were significant in the expected
direction, F(1, 44)=6.144, p=0.017, ƞ2p=0.12. That is, the mindful-
ness group showed a higher increment of EC from pretest to posttest
compared to the control group.
Regarding teachers reports, results showed an improvement from
pretest to posttest in total EF of children in the mindfulness group
compared to children in the control group, F(1, 41)=5.64, p=0.022,
ƞ2p=0.12. Specifically, children in the mindfulness group showed
improvements in behavioral regulation from pretest to posttest, F(1,
41)=5.63, p=0.022, ƞ2p=0.12, and on the emotion regulation index,
F(1, 41)=8.02, p=0.007, ƞ2p=0.16, with no change in the cogni-
tive regulation index, F(1,41)=1.69, p=0.201, ƞ2p=0.040. Overall,
whereas teachers reported an increase of EF from pretest to posttest
of children in mindfulness group, no change of EFs was observed in the
control group.
