Interest in the applications of mindfulness practice in education is growing in the sci-
entific community. Recent research has shown that mindfulness practice in schools
may be beneficial for executive functions (EFs) which are abilities crucial for healthy
development. The study of the effects of mindfulness practices on children’s neural cor-
relates of EFs, particularly inhibitory control, may provide relevant information about
the impact and mechanisms of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in children. The
aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a MBI in elementary school
children on the neural correlates of inhibitory control via a randomized controlled
trial. Children from two 4th grade classrooms and two 5th grade classrooms located
in a school identified as having low socioeconomic status in Santiago de Chile were
randomly assigned to either receive a MBI or serve as active controls and receive a
social skills program. Both before and after the interventions, electroencephalographic
activity was recorded during a modified version of the Go/Nogo task in a subsample
of children in each group. Additionally, teachers completed questionnaires of stu-
dents’ EFs and students completed self-report measures. Results revealed increases
in EFs assessed by questionnaires together with improved P3 amplitude associated
with successful response inhibition in children who received the MBI compared to
active controls. These results contribute to the understanding of the ways in which
mindfulness practices can promote the development of inhibitory control together
with EF improvement, factors identified as critical for children’s social and emotional
development and positive mental health.
