Interest in the applications of mindfulness practice in education is growing in the sci-
entific community. Recent research has shown that mindfulness practice in schools
may be beneficial for executive functions (EFs) which are abilities crucial for healthy
development. The study of the effects of mindfulness practices on children’s neural cor-
relates of EFs, particularly inhibitory control, may provide relevant information about
the impact and mechanisms of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in children. The
aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a MBI in elementary school
children on the neural correlates of inhibitory control via a randomized controlled
trial. Children from two 4th grade classrooms and two 5th grade classrooms located
in a school identified as having low socioeconomic status in Santiago de Chile were
randomly assigned to either receive a MBI or serve as active controls and receive a
social skills program. Both before and after the interventions, electroencephalographic
activity was recorded during a modified version of the Go/Nogo task in a subsample
of children in each group. Additionally, teachers completed questionnaires of stu-
dents’ EFs and students completed self-report measures. Results revealed increases
in EFs assessed by questionnaires together with improved P3 amplitude associated
with successful response inhibition in children who received the MBI compared to
active controls. These results contribute to the understanding of the ways in which
mindfulness practices can promote the development of inhibitory control together
with EF improvement, factors identified as critical for children’s social and emotional
development and positive mental health.

P3 activity associated with successful inhibition in children who received the MBI
were found.
∙The results could contribute to understand how mindfulness practice can promote
the development of inhibitory control in children from vulnerable populations.
1 INTRODUCTION
Socioeconomic status (SES), a measure of one’s overall status and posi-
tion in society, strongly influences an individual’s experiences from
childhood and through adult life. Growing up in a family with a low
SES background is associated with substantially worse health and
impaired psychological well-being, and decreased cognitive and emo-
tional development throughout the lifespan, being considered as a
risk factor for a healthy development (Hackman et al., 2010 ). Com-
pared with children and adolescents from higher-SES backgrounds,
children and adolescents from low-SES backgrounds show higher rates
of depression, anxiety, attention problems, and conduct disorders, and
a higher prevalence of internalizing and externalizing behaviors, all of
which increase with the duration of living in poverty (Hackman et al.,
2010 ). In addition, childhood SES influences cognitive development:
SES is positively correlated with intelligence and academic achieve-
ment from early childhood and through adolescence (Farah et al., 2006 ;
Hackman & Farah, 2009 ).
Childhood SES affects some neurocognitive systems more than
others: studies that assessed multiple neurocognitive systems found
moderate effects of SES on executive functions (EFs) — particu-
larly on working memory and inhibitory control (Hackman & Farah,
2009 ; Hackman et al., 2010 ; John et al., 2019 ). SES-related differ-
ences in the EFs of working memory and inhibitory control have been
noted in children as young as 6 −14 months of age (Hackman et al.,
2015 ). SES- related differences in executive attentional systems have
been reported in 6-year-old children, and SES-related disparities in
various tasks of executive function have been described at multi-
ple developmental stages through early adolescence (Hackman et al.,
2015 ).
EFs refer to a group of cognitive control abilities that organize,
sequence, and regulate behavior (Diamond, 2013 ; Schonert-Reichl
et al., 2015 ). One core EF is inhibitory control, which refers to the
capacity to control one’s attention, behavior, thoughts, and/or emo-
tions to handle a strong internal predisposition and respond in a willful
and non-reactive way (Diamond, 2013 ). More broadly, self-regulation
involves the use of inhibitory control and is highly related witheffortful control (EC), a temperamental predisposition for better or
worse self-regulation (Checa et al., 2014 ; Diamond, 2013 ). Children
with poor EFs (particularly inhibitory control) have been shown to have
poorer outcomes in adulthood such as having worse health, impaired
self-regulation (Rueda et al., 2005 ), lower prosocial behaviors (Aguilar-
Pardo et al., 2013 ), are less happy, commit more crimes, and develop
several EFs disorders (Diamond & Lee, 2011 ; Moffitt et al., 2011 ). In
fact, EFs are critical for every aspect of life, including success in school,
academic abilities, positive friendships, mental and physical health, and
overall quality of life (Diamond & Lee, 2011 ). Thus, improving EFs early
in life is crucial (Diamond & Lee, 2011 ). EFs are malleable from an early
age, and children with the weakest EFs show the most significant bene-
fits from any intervention to train EFs (Diamond, 2013 ; Diamond & Lee,
2011 ). Importantly, school-based interventions improve EFs (Diamond,
2012 ;L i e w , 2011 ; Meltzer, 2018 ).
The school is an active critical agent of development and a trans-
formative context (Erikson, 1987 ; Mills, 2008 ). One of the functions
of schooling is to reduce social inequalities by providing all children
with academic and social and emotional skills to diminish gaps in SES
and overcome them (Downey et al., 2004 ; von Hippel, et al., 2018 ).
Schools in the 21st century play a key role in the development of differ-
ent cognitive and social and emotional abilities (Mind & Life Education
Research Network, 2012 ), and the comprehensive mission of schools is
to educate students to be knowledgeable, responsible, socially skilled,
healthy, caring, and contributing citizens. Given the large amount of
time that youth spend in school, this is an ideal context to implement
universal prevention programs that address core elements of social,
emotional, and cognitive development (Hale et al., 2014 ), including the
promotion of students’ EFs.
School-based social and emotional learning (SEL) interventions have
been found to improve EFs and to be cost-effective in the long term
(Belfield et al., 2015 ; Heckman & Mosso, 2014 ). Research has shown
that SEL interventions that incorporate mindfulness attention prac-
tices lead to improvements in students’ EFs (Schonert-Reichl et al.,
2015 ). Mindfulness is broadly defined as “self-regulation of atten-
tion to the conscious awareness of one’s immediate experiences while
adopting an attitude of curiosity, openness, and acceptance” (Bishop,
 14677687, 2023, 6, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.13403 by Oregon Health & Science Univer, Wiley Online Library on [08/05/2024].

2004 , p. 174). Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are sustained
and systematic training in formal and informal practices of mindful-
ness meditation to improve mindfulness skills. MBIt’s participants learn
a more adaptive way to relate to their feelings, thoughts, and emo-
tions supporting the development of greater attentional, emotional
and behavioral self-regulation, as well as positive prosocial qualities
such as kindness and compassion (Crane et al., 2017 ). In the last decade,
interest in mindfulness-based interventions applied in educational set-
tings have had a rapid expansion, accompanied by the exponential
growth of empirical research documenting the benefits of mindfulness
practices in schools (for a review, see Weare, 2019 ).
Theoretically, MBIs in schools have an impact on increasing both EFs
and mindfulness skills (Andreu & García-Rubio, 2019 ;L a w l o r , 2016 ;
Lyons & DeLange, 2016 ; Mendelson, et al., 2010 ; Mind and Life Educa-
tion Research Network, 2012 ; Waters, et al., 2014 ) .I nt h es a m el i n e ,
mindfulness skills in children have been positively related with EFs,
particularly inhibitory control (Riggs et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, recent
systematic reviews and meta-analyses have found positive effects of
MBIs on EFs in children and adolescents (Dunning et al., 2018 ;M a k
et al., 2018 ; Maynard et al., 2017 ). For example, teacher-reported
improvements in adolescents EFs have been shown with a school-
based mindfulness intervention (Lam & Seiden, 2020 ). However, Felver
et al. ( 2015 ) warned that most of the studies in the field did not use rig-
orous experimental designs: lacked active control groups, used a single
informant (typically only children), used a single methodology (typi-
cally self-reports), and did not use multi-level measurements to assess
outcomes (neural, cognitive, behavioral). Specially significant was the
shortage of studies designed to elucidate the impact of MBIs in school
on the neural correlates of core cognitive functions in development,
such as EFs.
The use of electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate the neuronal
correlates of EFs is well established in adults and children. EEG and the
event-related potentials (ERPs) methodology provide several advan-
tages for the neurocognitive research on EFs (Huster et al., 2013 ;
Kaunhoven & Dorjee, 2017 ; Sanger & Dorjee, 2015 ). The Go/Nogo
task, one of the most classic paradigms used to investigate EFs in the
laboratory, has been particularly relevant for the study of neural corre-
lates of inhibitory control. Behavioral indices in a Go/Nogo task include
the omission errors in Go trials and the commission errors in Nogo
trials, which require inhibitory control ability, as well as the reaction
times (RTs) to different types of trials. One proposed ERPs neural cor-
relate of inhibitory control that reflect changes in brain activity needed
to inhibit response in a Go/Nogo task is the P3 component (Huster
et al., 2013 ). Indeed, the P3 is thought to reflect represent a tempo-
rally precise neural marker of the response inhibition process (Albert
et al., 2013 ; Dykstra et al., 2020 ; Sánchez-Carmona et al., 2016 ;W e s -
sel & Aron, 2015 ). Differential amplitudes of P3 are described both
on several EF disorders in adults and children (Luijten et al., 2014 ;
Lopez-Martin et al., 2015 ).
Several studies have employed experimental tasks to measure the
impact of mindfulness trainings in children (e.g., Felver et al., 2014 ;
Napoli et al., 2005 ; Schonert-Reichl et al., 2015 ), yet only a few have
used EEG or ERP methodology. Siripornpanich et al. ( 2018 ) assessed
children who have been studied in two schools with different typesof school curriculum: mindfulness-based curriculum (i.e., mindfulness
practices for all levels of education) versus usual curriculum. Chil-
dren who received the mindfulness education curriculum showed
lower theta power and smaller theta/beta ratio compared to control
children, suggesting enhanced maturation of brain areas related to
cognitive control and self-regulation. However, in the absence of a
randomization process, and the lack of baseline levels of children in
the two groups, the possibility that these differences existed previ-
ously between groups or were due to other elements of the curricula
could not be excluded. In another study with adolescents, the ampli-
tude of the P3b component was measured during an affective oddball
task, before and after mindfulness training. The P3b amplitude in the
control group decreased between testing sessions but it remained
unchanged in the mindfulness group, suggesting a maintained sensitiv-
ity to emotional stimuli in mindfulness-trained students (Sanger et al.,
2018 ).
Thus, as previous studies are done in adolescents, to our knowledge
there are no published studies who have specifically used ERP meth-
ods in children to evaluate possible effects of MBIs in schools on EFs
or other cognitive processes. The main aim of the present study was
to assess the impact of a school-based mindfulness intervention on the
neural correlates of EFs, specifically inhibitory control, in children. Via
a randomized controlled trial, we examined the effectiveness of an MBI
in 4th and 5th grade children attending a school identified as vulnerable
due to its low SES. We measured behavioral and EEG neural responses
on a Go/Nogo task to evaluate inhibitory control. We expected lower
error rates and decreased reaction times together with an increase
in P3 amplitude (particularly in No-Go trials) in the MBI intervention
group compared to the control group. Also, we measured the impact of
the MBI on children’s mindfulness skills via self-report and EFs’ via self-
and teachers-reports. We expected improvements in mindfulness skills
and EFs in children in the MBI group compared to children in the active
control intervention.
2 METHOD
2.1 Participants
Prior to participant recruitment, the Ethics Committee of the Pon-
tificia Universidad Católica de Chile approved the study. The school
in which the study took place was selected based on a low-SES and
vulnerable context. According to the Chilean Index of Scholar Vulner-
ability, the school was rated with an index of 74%, which corresponds
to a medium-high risk of vulnerability. The aim of the study was pre-
sented to teachers, students, and students from four 4th and 5th grade
classrooms were recruited (age range 9–11 years old).
The total sample for the global study was N=133 (67 in the mindful-
ness group). From this initial group, 68 children were chosen at random
(N=68; 34 from the mindfulness group) to become part of this EEG
study, and were subsequently evaluated with EEG. The results of the
pre-post EEG and questionnaires of this sample are presented here.
Of the 68 children who were evaluated with EEG, 46 remained in the
final sample, and the data of 22 children were discarded. Thus, the final

sample for all analysis presented in this report consisted of 24 children
in the mindfulness group and 22 children in the active control group,
after participant elimination. As recommended in the literature, only
correct trials were analyzed for Go/Nogo EEG activity, and to ensure
an appropriate signal to noise ratio, a minimum of 15 artifact-free trials
per condition was set as a criterion for inclusion in the analysis (Hus-
ter et al., 2013 ; Rietdijk et al., 2014 ). Therefore, the main reasons for
excluding participants were a high task error rate and/or a high number
of trials with large artifacts that cannot be corrected by the Indepen-
dent Component Analysis (ICA) procedure, leaving too few correct
trials (less than 15) for analysis (please see Behavioral and EEG Data
Analysis section for the complete procedure of data analysis). A dia-
gram of the participant flow through the study is shown in Figure 1.A
summary of demographic information for the subsample used in this
study can be seen in Table 1. No significant pre-test differences were
identified between groups (all p>0.05).
2.2 Procedure
After the collection of baseline data, randomization to study condition
was done via a coin flip that assigned two of the four classrooms (one
from 4th and one from 5th grade) to receive the MBI and two to receive
the program that focused on the promotion of social skills (active con-
trol group). At pre-test, all procedures were explained to participants,
and informed consent/assent was obtained before. Before and after
interventions, EEG and questionnaire data were collected. For EEG
data, participants were tested individually during school hours using aBiosemi EEG system mounted in a private and quiet room on school
premises. Participants were asked to come to their testing sessions
with clean, dry hair and not to use any hair products or conditioner.
The same procedure was repeated after the intervention period (post
time). EEG signals were recorded using a Biosemi Active-Two ampli-
fier system and 32 scalp Ag/AgCl electrodes mounted in an elastic cap
according to the 10–20 system. Four additional electrodes were fixed
on the left and right mastoids and below and above the left eye (VEOG).
All signals were digitized with a sampling rate of 2048 Hz and 24-
bit A/D conversion. For questionnaires, the children self-reports were
administered by researchers during school hours. Teachers of each
classroom supervised the administration, which took approximately 45
min to complete each assessment. Also, the headteachers completed
the EF reports of each child in their classrooms. The headteacher took
approximately 15 min to complete each child report at both pre-test
and post-test and received a total of 380 dollars in compensation for
their time.

secular mindfulness-based intervention for children ages 7–12 years
and is specifically designed to be implemented in a school context. The
general aim of the program is to foster the children’s development.
Specifically, the aims of the GrowingUp Breathing program are to (1)
increase mindfulness skills, (2) increase attention and self-regulation
processes (EF and emotion regulation), and (3) cultivate prosocial
(e.g., kindness, compassion) dispositions. The methodology of the pro-
gram is experiential, interactive, participatory, and student-centered.
It combines traditional third-person knowledge-based learning with
first-person experiential learning through mindfulness practices.
The GrowingUp Breathing program consists of nine 50-min ses-
sions, with one session being implemented each week. The nine
sessions are divided into three modules (Attention, Self-Regulation,
and Kindness modules), plus an integration and summary session.
Attentional training allows the improvement of self-regulation pro-
cesses, which increase the probability of reflexive, non-reactive, and
prosocial behaviors. In the Attention Module (3.5 sessions), children
learn what mindfulness is, how the attention works, and how to bring
it back when it wanders (attentional regulation). The core practices of
this module are mindfulness of Breathing, mindfulness of sounds, mind-
ful movement, body scan, and breathing space. In the Self-Regulation
Module (3.5 sessions), children learn self-regulation skills (decenter-
ing and de-identification) to manage unpleasant feelings, thoughts,
and emotions. Children learn to act reflexively and not impulsively.
In this module, the core practices are mindful eating, mindfulness of
thoughts and emotions, and breathing space (react vs. respond in dif-
ficult times). In the Kindness Module (1.5 sessions), children explore
how to take care of oneself and others. The core practices in this
module are loving-kindness and self-compassion meditation. Executive
functions are trained throughout the entire program, mainly through
formal meditation practices that are designed to train the contents ofeach module. In a previous qualitative study, children from the same
at-risk context report how the program helped them to have better
self-regulation (Andreu et al., 2021 ).
Other essential elements of the GrowingUp Breathing interven-
tion are the theoretical lessons, exercises, games, and weekly practice.
Weekly practices are divided into three different types of practice.
First, teachers receive mindfulness-mp3 audios to use it two times per
week before the next session with the children. Second, children carry
out Breathing Space Practice three times per day during school time.
Finally, between sessions, children are suggested to carry out different
practices (“challenges”) related to the content of the session.
Finally, a fundamental core practice for the learning process in
the GrowingUp Breathing program is the inquiry process. The inquiry
process is a central component in the pedagogy and methodology of
MBIs, and it is the catalyst that encourages reflection and exploration
through instructor-student-group dialogue. Through mindful teach-
ing (calm, clear, and kind), the instructor promotes an emotionally
supportive classroom climate, which encourages students to engage
in mindfulness practices and to share and reflect in the group. The
program was taught by an experienced psychologist and mindfulness
instructor and was provided universally to children as part of their
standard classroom instruction during regular school hours. Details of
each session of the program (objectives, themes, core practices, and
weekly practices) can be found in the Table S1.
2.3.2 Active control group: Skills-for life program
Children of the active control group received an adapted version of the
Skills-for Life (SFL) Program (Ministry of Education of Chile, 2018 ). SFL
is Chile’s government-funded universal prevention program developed
 14677687, 2023, 6, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/desc.13403 by Oregon Health & Science Univer, Wiley Online Library on [08/05/2024]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License

6o f1 4 ANDREU ET AL .
for the promotion of social-emotional competencies and academic out-
comes, prevention of mental health problems, and improvement of
positive coexistence in the educational community. SFL is run by a
division (National Association of School Assistance and Scholarship
JUNAEB; Junta Nacional de Auxilio Escolar y Becas) of the National
Department of Education in Chile, and it is the largest school-based
mental health program in Chile providing services to more than one
million students in Chile over the past decade (Guzmán et al., 2015 ).
The program is specially designed to be implemented in schools with a
population with high socio-economic vulnerability and high psychoso-
cial risk levels. The SFL Program has been shown to decrease the
risk factors associated with school and social maladjustment and to
improve studentst’ autonomy, socio-emotional skills, behavior, and aca-
demic outcomes (Delgado et al., 2006 ; Guzmán et al., 2015 ; Leiva et al.,
2016 ; Murphy et al., 2014 ).
For this study, two expert psychologists trained in the SFL Pro-
gram adapted the program to be implemented with children aged
9–11 years. The curriculum was applied during nine weekly sessions,
50 min per each, in parallel to the mindfulness-based intervention.
The methodology of the program was experiential, interactive, partic-
ipatory, and student-centered. The objective of the program was the
promotion of social-emotional skills other than mindfulness and the
improvement of the classroom climate. Through different dynamics
(e.g., role-playings) and games (e.g., collective mandala), the students
reflected in each class on a specific topic and developed emotional
and social skills useful for their school and family context. The themes
of the nine sessions were: Group Cohesion, Self-concept, Self-esteem,
Treating others well, Cyberbullying, Emotional recognition, Emotional
expression, Conflict resolution (dialogue) and Summary and Integra-
tion. Details of the intervention can be found in the Table S2.
2.4 Measures
2.4.1 Go/Nogo task
A previous Go/Nogo task was adapted for this study (Albert et al.,
2013 ). Stimuli consisted of three capital letters (“N,” “M,” and “W”) col-
ored in yellow so they clearly highlighted from the black background on
which they were superimposed. Children participants were instructed
to press a button, as fast and accurate as possible, whenever the let-
ters “M” or “N” were presented, and to withhold pressing when the
letter presented was “W.” They were asked to look continuously at
the center of the screen in order to control eye-movement interfer-
ence. The Go/Nogo task consisted of two blocks of 150 trials, with rest
time between blocks. Each trial began with the presentation of the let-
ter (400 ms), followed by a black screen (700 or 900 ms). Both letter
and fixation cross were superimposed at the center of the black back-
ground. The letters “M” (infrequent-Go) and “W” (infrequent-Nogo)
were presented with the same probability of occurrence (20%) in order
to equalize both types of trials with respect to novelty processing. The
letter “N” (frequent-Go) was presented in the rest of the trials (60%)
to increase the subjects’ tendency to respond. The three types of trials(frequent-Go, infrequent- Go, and infrequent-Nogo) were presented
in semi-random order (i.e., avoiding the consecutive presentation of
two infrequent-trials). Before the beginning of the experiment, partic-
ipants completed a practice block of 12 trials (4 infrequent-Nogo) to
ensure task instruction understanding. The task took about 10 min to
complete, including resting time. After the Go/Nogo task participant
completed an Eriksen flanker task adapted for children but results are
not reported here.
2.4.2 Questionnaires
Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure (CAMM)
Dispositional mindfulness was measured by the Child and Adoles-
cent Mindfulness Measure (CAMM; Greco et al., 2011 ). The CAMM
assesses mindfulness as the “lack of present-moment awareness as
well as judgmental and non-accepting responses to thoughts and feel-
ings” (Greco et al., 2011 , p. 609). It comprises 10 items (e.g., “I get upset
with myself for having feelings that do not make sense” or “get upset
with myself for having certain thoughts’’) in a 5-point Likert scale rang-
ing from 0 (”never true“) to 4 (”always true"). After recoding the scores
on inverse items, higher scores on the CAMM indicate higher mind-
fulness skills. In this study, Spanish validation of the CAMM was used
(García-Rubio et al., 2019 ), showing adequate reliability ( α=0.84).
Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire-Revised (EATQ-R)
EC were self-reported by children using The Early Adolescent Temper-
ament Questionnaire-Revised (Ellis & Rothbart, 2001 ). The EATQ-R is
a revised and updated version of the EATQ (Capaldi & Rothbart, 1992 )
to assess more precisely aspects of self-regulation. EATQ-R consists
of 11 scales. In this study, the higher-order factor EC was calculated
with the attentional control and inhibitory control subscales. EC is
a very close construct to EF (Snyder et al., 2015 ) and is defined as
“the ability to inhibit a dominant response to perform a subdominant
response” (Rothbart & Bates, 2006 ; p. 137), involving the recruitment
of attentional and behavioral processes to modulate affective reactiv-
ity (Rueda, et al., 2005 ). Each item was measured on a five-point Likert
scale ranging from 1 (almost never true) to 5 (almost always true).
Higher scores reflect higher abilities. In the sample of this study, the
reliability of the EC was α=0.64.
Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, second
edition—Teacher form (BRIEF2-Teacher form)
EFs were measured using the BRIEF2-Teacher Form (Gioia et al., 2015 ;
Maldonado et al., 2017 ). The BRIEF2- Teacher Form is a teacher report
that measures the EF of children and adolescents aged 5–18 years.
Specifically, the BRIEF-2 – Teacher Form evaluates everyday children

three composite indexes and nine subscales: Behavior Regulation Index
(BRI; comprised of the Inhibit and Self-Monitor subscales), Emotion
Regulation Index (ERI; comprised of the Shift and Emotional Control
subscales), and Cognitive Regulation Index (CRI; comprised of the Initi-
ate, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, Task-Monitor, and Organization
of Materials subscales). The Global Executive Composite, the Behav-
ior Regulation, the Emotion Regulation, and the Cognitive Regulation
Indexes were analyzed. The Behavioral Regulation Index indicates the
teacher’s perception of the child’s level of difficulty in regulating and
supervising their behaviors effectively. The Emotion Regulation Index
reports the teacher’s perception of the child’s ability in regulating and
modulating emotional responses, especially in response to changing
situations. The Cognitive Regulation Index reflects the child’s abil-
ity to control and manage cognitive processes and to problem solve
effectively. Higher scores indicate greater problems in EF and lower
scores reflect better EFs. The BRIEF2 – Teacher Form is widely used
and has shown adequate validity and reliability properties ( α=0.88–
0.98) (Gioia et al., 2015 ; Maldonado et al., 2017 ). BRIEF2 – Teacher
Form has demonstrated a significant correlation with the ADHD-RS-
IV, CBCL-TRF, BASC-2 TRS, and Conners 3-T(S) measures, which are
widely used to assess children’s attention, self-regulation and mental
health (for a review, see Hendrickson & McCrimmon, 2018 ). In the sam-
ple of this study, the reliability of the BRIEF-2 – Teacher Form was
excellent ( α=0.97).
Attendance, acceptability, and personal practice
Participants’ attendance rate to the program was determined by con-
trolling the number of sessions that each student missed (i.e., none, one,
two, three, or more sessions). Also, children assessed acceptability and
satisfaction with the programs at the end of them. Each student rated
3 items on a 0–10 Likert scale (i.e., Did you like the mindfulness/skills
for life program?; Would you recommend a mindfulness/skills for life
program to a friend?; Did you find helpful the mindfulness/skills for life
program?; 0 =Never; 10 =Always). In addition, the personal practice
was assessed asking the children about if they had been used the prac-
tices and exercises taught throughout the programs: Have you used
in your day-to-day in and outside the school (e.g., home) what you
learned on the mindfulness/skills for life program; Have you used inter-
sessions the different practices learned on the mindfulness/skills for
life program?; 0 =Never; 10=Always).
2.5 Data analysis
2.5.1 Behavioral and EEG data analysis
For EEG, after acquisition, data were segmented in epochs of 1 s
(200 ms before and 800 ms after stimulus onset) and only trials
with valid responses were analyzed (correct go trials with responses
between 150 and 1100 ms after onset, correct nogo trials without
response). Data were low-pass filtered below 35 Hz and re-referenced
to the average mastoids. Artifact rejection was based on a three-step
procedure. First, we used Independent Component Analysis (ICA) toremove eye-blinks or muscular activity, since it uses spatial filtering
and preserves ERP contributions, in contrast to other methods such
as filtering or regression (Jung, Makeig, Humphries, et al., 2000 ; Jung,
Makeig, Westerfield, et al., 2000 ). Then, noisy channels were interpo-
lated using data of adjacent electrodes (mean ±SD of interpolated
electrodes per participant and time: 2.2 ±1.9). Finally, trials in which
the EEG signal exceeded ±150 mV after baseline correction ( −200 to
0 ms) were automatically excluded. Only participants with at least 15
error-free trials per condition were analyzed, yielding a final sample
of 46 participants (see Participants section for a detailed description;
the number of trials did not differ between groups in any condition at
either pre or post-test, all ps>0.05). ERP waves were computed for
each condition (Go frequent, Go infrequent and Nogo), participant (46),
and time (pre and post). Then, ERP data across participants was decom-
posed by ICA (3 conditions ×46 participants ×2 times ERPs for each
electrode). The resulting independent components were explored by
means of visual inspection, identifying a meaningful component as P3
based on its scalp topography and time course. For the analysis, the
average of amplitude of the P3 maximum amplitude time point ±10 ms
was used.
Repeated-measures ANOVAs were used with Group (mindfulness-
training vs. active control group) and Time (pre, post) in all analyses
as factors. For behavioral data, percentage error rates (both omis-
sions and commissions: no responses in Go trials and button presses
in Nogo trials, respectively) and mean reaction times (RTs) for the
correct frequent and infrequent-go trials were analyzed. Repeated-
measures ANOVAs on each behavioral measure were carried out using
Trial type (frequent-Go, infrequent-Go, infrequent-Nogo), Group and
Time as factors. To examine the effects of mindfulness training on Nogo
P3, we conducted repeated-measures ANOVA, with Group and Time as
factors. The Greenhouse–Geisser (GG) epsilon correction was applied
to adjust the degrees of freedom of the F ratios where necessary,
and post hoc comparisons were also made in order to determine the
significance of pair-wise contrasts applying the Bonferroni procedure
(alpha 0.05). For all analyses, the level of significance employed was
0.05. Effect sizes were computed using the partial eta-square ( ƞ2p). For
interpreting effect sizes, Cohen’s ( 1988 ) cutoff criteria were followed:
ƞ2p=0.01 as small effect size, ƞ2p=0.06 as medium effect size, and
ƞ2p=0.14 as large effect size.
2.5.2 Questionnaires data analysis
Relative to self-reports completed by children, there was no attrition
from pre to post-interventions (Nexp =24; Ncon=22). With regard
to questionnaires completed by teachers, questionnaires for three chil-
dren were not completed at post-intervention (i.e., the questionnaires
of two children from the mindfulness group and one child from the con-
trol group were not completed). Hence, we decided to exclude these
participants from the teacher reports analysis (Nexp =22; Ncon=21).
We used the SPSS Missing Value Analysis package to estimate the
patterns of missing data for children and teachers. Little’s MCAR
test (Little & Rubin, 1989 ) was not significant for child self-report

data ( χ2 [769]=13,548, p=1.000) and for teacher reports data ( χ2
[1749]=6370, p=1.000), indicating that the missing data did not show
a significant pattern and we could consider that data were missing at
random.
We examined the baseline differences between groups (i.e., mind-
fulness and control group) for dependent variables of children’s self-
reports and teachers’ reports by t-test. Repeated-measures ANOVAs
were used with Group (mindfulness vs. active control group) and Time
(pre, post) in all analyses as factors. The Greenhouse–Geisser (GG)
epsilon correction was applied to adjust the degrees of freedom of the
F ratios where necessary, and post hoc comparisons were also made in
order to determine the significance of pair-wise contrasts applying the
Bonferroni procedure (alpha 0.05). For all analyses, the level of signifi-
cance employed was 0.05. Effect sizes were computed using the partial
eta-square ( ƞ2p). For interpreting effect sizes, Cohen’s ( 1988 ) cutoff
criteria were followed: ƞ2p=0.01 as small effect size, ƞ2p=0.06 as
medium effect size, and ƞ2p=0.14 as large effect size.
3 RESULTS
3.1 ERP data
The ICA applied on the previous computed ERPs revealed a fronto-
central P3 component between 377 and 434 ms after stimulus onset.Figure 2shows its topography and waveforms for both times and
groups and all different trials of the Go/Nogo task. No significant
baseline difference in Nogo P3 amplitude was found ( t(44)=0.757,
p=0.453). A 2 ×2 ANOVA with factors of Time (pre, post) and Group
(mindfulness group, active control group) assessed possible changes
across time in mean amplitudes of the frontocentral P3 on Nogo tri-
als (Figure 2). There was a marginally significant main effect of time
(F(1, 44)=4.176, p=0.047, ƞ2p=0.087), and no significant main effect
of group ( F(1, 44)=0.141, p=0.709). Importantly, the time-by-group
interaction was significant ( F(1, 44)=5.287, p=0.026, ƞ2p=0.107).
Results showed an important increment of the Nogo-P3 amplitude in
the mindfulness group over time, and a slight decrease from pre to
post in the active control group. No other significant interactions were
found (Figure 2).
3.2 Behavioral data
Performance on the Go/Nogo task is shown in Table 2. For the Go trials
(frequent and infrequent-go), it shows means of error rates (omission
errors in percentages), and means RTs. For the Nogo trials, it shows
means of error rates (commission errors in percentage). Preliminary
analyses were conducted to examine pre-intervention group differ-
ences in behavioral data. There were no significant pre-intervention
group differences in error rates and RTs (all p>0.05), except for errors

showed higher error rate.
With respect to percentage error rates, a significant main effect
of trial type was observed ( F(2,88)=379.6, p<0.001, ƞ2p=0.896).
Percentage error rates were higher for Nogo trials (i.e., commis-
sion errors) than for frequent- and infrequent- Go trials (omis-
sion errors), as expected. Also, group difference ( F(1,44)=4.356,
p=0.043, ƞ2p=0.09) and time-by-trial type interaction were sig-
nificant ( F(2,88)=10.712, p<0.001, ƞ2p=0.196), indicated higher
error rates among students in the active control group compared
to students in the mindfulness group. Moreover, the analysis indi-
cated that students in both groups improved their performance,
particularly with regard to commission errors within time. No other
significant effects or interactions were found regarding to error
rates.
Regarding RTs, a significant main effect of Go-trial type (frequent
and infrequent) was found ( F(1,44)=9.277, p=0.004, ƞ2p=0.174).
In general, correct responses to infrequent-go trials were larger
(higher reaction times) than correct responses to frequent-go trials
(slower reaction times). Additionally, a main effect of Time was found
(F(1,44)=20.9, p<0.001, ƞ2p=0.322), showing a general decrease in
frequent- and infrequent-go RTs at post-test compared to pre-test. No
other significant effect or interaction was found.
In summary, the mindfulness group, relative to the active control
group, did not change after the intervention in the reaction times in the
Go trials. However, in general, the percentage of errors in the control
group was higher than in the mindfulness group.
3.3 Questionnaires
3.3.1 Baseline comparisons
Preliminary analyses were conducted to examine pre-intervention
group differences across gender, age, and all of the dependent vari-
ables in the study. There were no significant group differences atbaseline on socio-demographic characteristics: gender ( χ2 [1]=0.006,
p=0.936), and age ( t(44)=0.903, p=0.371). There were no significant
pre-intervention group differences in children’s self-reports on mind-
fulness ( t(43)=0.007, p=0.994) and effortful control ( t(44)=1.462,
p=0.151). There were no significant pre-intervention group dif-
ferences on teacherst’ reports of children’s EF as assessed via the
BRIEF Global Index ( t(41)=0.697, p=0.489), behavioral regula-
tion ( t(41)=1.314, p=0.196), cognitive regulation ( t(41)=−0.496,
p=0.623) and emotion regulation indexes ( t(41)=1.120, p=0.269).
3.3.2 Intervention effects
Pretest and posttest means and standard deviations as well as differ-
ences in change scores for all dependent variables (i.e., mindfulness, EC,
EF, behavioral regulation, emotion regulation, and cognitive regulation)
by intervention group are reported in Table 3.
With regard to child self-reports, the results for mindfulness indi-
cated a significant change from pretest to posttest, F(1, 43)=5.101,
p=0.029, ƞ2p=0.11, indicating differences between the mindfulness
and control group, with a decrease in mindfulness scores in the control
group. Also, the results regarding EC were significant in the expected
direction, F(1, 44)=6.144, p=0.017, ƞ2p=0.12. That is, the mindful-
ness group showed a higher increment of EC from pretest to posttest
compared to the control group.
Regarding teachers reports, results showed an improvement from
pretest to posttest in total EF of children in the mindfulness group
compared to children in the control group, F(1, 41)=5.64, p=0.022,
ƞ2p=0.12. Specifically, children in the mindfulness group showed
improvements in behavioral regulation from pretest to posttest, F(1,
41)=5.63, p=0.022, ƞ2p=0.12, and on the emotion regulation index,
F(1, 41)=8.02, p=0.007, ƞ2p=0.16, with no change in the cogni-
tive regulation index, F(1,41)=1.69, p=0.201, ƞ2p=0.040. Overall,
whereas teachers reported an increase of EF from pretest to posttest
of children in mindfulness group, no change of EFs was observed in the
control group.

3.3.3 Attendance, acceptability, and personal
practice
Because the sessions were regularly scheduled in the curriculum dur-
ing the academic schedule, there was a high attendance rate for both
programs. For the mindfulness intervention group, 50% of children
attended all mindfulness sessions, 33% missed one session, 12% missed
two sessions, and 5% missed three sessions. For the active control
group (SFL), 67% of children attended all SFL sessions, 22% missed
one session, 5% missed two sessions, and 5% missed three sessions.
There were no differences in the attendance rate between groups
(t(41)=−1.160, p=0.253). The acceptability was high in both the
mindfulness group ( M=8.45, SD=2.78), and the active control group
(M=8.54, SD=2.63). Also, personal practice was moderately high in
the mindfulness group ( M=6.69, SD=3.95), and the control group
(M=7.04, SD=3.40). There were no differences between groups
in acceptability ( t(44)=−0.109, p=0.914) and personal practice
(t(42)=−0.328, p=0.744).
4 DISCUSSION
In this study, we examined the effects of a mindfulness-based inter-
vention in children in a high-risk context on inhibitory control and
its underlying neural mechanisms. Compared to an active control
group, children that received the MBI showed less error rates in the
Go/Nogo task for all trial types. No differences in reaction times
were found between groups. Additionally, children in the mindfulness
group showed increased EC, global EFs, emotion and behavioral regu-
lation after the intervention, evidenced by child self-report and teacher
reports. Furthermore, EEG results revealed significant differences in
the P3 amplitude; with children in the mindfulness group showing an
increased Nogo-P3 amplitude and children in the control group show-
ing a slight decrease in P3 amplitude over time. Taken together, thisis one of the first studies to provide empirical evidence that an MBI
in a vulnerable school context increases children’s EFs, attention, and
inhibitory control. Importantly, the effects were evidenced by both
behavioral and neural indices, showing that frontocentral P3 amplitude
may underlie this effect. Following recent recommendations (Felver
et al., 2015 ), the use of an active control group allowed us to better con-
trol for non-specific effects and particularly, this study used as an active
control a very well evaluated social skills intervention that is widely
used in vulnerable schools in Chile, making it a very strict comparison.
Behaviorally, children that participated in the MBI showed a gen-
eral lower error rate in the Go/Nogo task compared to control children.
Interestingly, this was true for all task trials and times, including pre-
test. The Go/Nogo task we used (Albert et al., 2013 ) allowed us to
analyze attention-related effects with frequent versus infrequent go
trials and inhibition-related effects with infrequent go trials versus
nogo trials (infrequent go and nogo trials have the same proportion).
As the effects were observed in all task trials, this result may reflect
increased global attention rather than a specific effect of inhibitory
control. This result is very interesting since previous evidence shows
that mindfulness trains attention in adults but also in children (Zen-
ner et al., 2014 ) and attention is entirely associated with executive
functioning (Checa et al., 2014 ; Diamond, 2013 ). Moreover, according
to child self-report questionnaires EC (which include attentional con-
trol) increased in the mindfulness group over time compared to control
group, which is in line with behavioral task interpretation of results.
However, it cannot be stated that it is a consequence of the interven-
tion per se, since there was an overall group effect and there were
previous differences between groups in the case of frequent-go errors.
Regarding EEG results, we expected increased amplitudes of P3 in
the mindfulness group over time, particularly in Nogo-P3 which has
been proposed as a reliable neural index of motor inhibition (Albert
et al., 2013 ; Dykstra et al., 2020 ; Sánchez-Carmona et al., 2016 ;W e s -
sel & Aron, 2015 ). Our electrophysiological results closely matched the
behavioral results: children in the mindfulness training group showed

increased P3 amplitude on Nogo trials, compared to children in the
active control condition, who showed a minor decreased amplitude
over time. A previous study with the same Go/Nogo task indicated
that the frontocentral P3 showed larger amplitudes for Nogo than
for infrequent Go trials, suggesting that Nogo P3 is the ERP activ-
ity most associated with inhibitory control (Albert et al., 2013 ). Our
results showed, for the first time, a specific mindfulness-related effect
in this inhibition-related neural activity in youth, which would indi-
cate increased inhibitory control in children after an MBI. Increased
inhibitory control in children after a MBI was shown previously only
with behavioral or self-reported data (Mak et al., 2018 ; Schonert-
Reichl et al., 2015 ). In adolescents, previous EEG studies have shown
changes in P3b amplitudes after MBI but using tasks that measure
different cognitive/affective processes which are not comparable to a
pure inhibitory control task such as Go/Nogo (Sanger & Dorjee, 2015 ;
Sanger et al., 2018 ). Given the importance of inhibitory control in chil-
dren and specially in our particular population of high-risk children, we
considered that our results are extremely relevant.
Questionnaires data from multiple informants (children and teach-
ers) supports our behavioral and EEG results. Self-reported results
from children showed increased EC in the mindfulness-training group
compared with control group over time and a significant intervention
effect on mindfulness, showing a slight increase in mindfulness for the
intervention group and a significant decrease in mindfulness in the
control group. Although it may be counterintuitive to see a drop of
mindfulness in the control group, these findings may be interpreted
within the context of the cognitive changes that occur during the devel-
opmental period of early adolescence—ages 9–13 years. Specifically,
early adolescence in particular has been described as a time in the life
cycle in which there is heightened self-consciousness due to increased
competence in cognitive and social cognitive abilities (Schonert-Reichl,
1994 ) and information processing. Developmental changes may lead to
increased attention and reflection on the self, which may then direct
the early adolescent to adopt a more critical view of the self (Eccles &
Roeser, 2009 ) and a subsequent drop in present-moment awareness
as well as judgmental and non-accepting responses to thoughts and
feelings. Hence, this drop in mindfulness in the control group may be
reflective of the typical developmental trajectory of early adolescents.
The mindfulness intervention may have staved off this typical decline
in dispositional mindfulness for students in the intervention group.
Assessments from teachers showed increased behavioral regulation,
emotion regulation, and global executive functioning in children of the
mindfulness group compared to controls over time. Collectively, the
results suggested increased EFs, particularly inhibitory and attentional
control in vulnerable children after the mindfulness-based interven-
tion. Previous studies have shown improved EFs in children after MBIs
in schools (Mak et al., 2018 ; Schonert-Reichl et al., 2015 ). Execu-
tive functioning has been distinguished in “hot and cool”: top-down
processes that operate in emotionally significant situations versus
affectively neutral contexts (Zelazo & Carlson, 2012 ). It is interesting to
see that the concept of hot EF suggests that motivationally significant
contexts demand different top-down processes than neutral contexts.
Following this distinction, the electrophysiological results observedin the Go/Nogo task clearly correspond to cool EF while the results
reported by teachers may be associated with hot EF, where children
were evaluated in emotionally challenging situations (particularly with
inhibition and emotional regulation subscales of the BRIEF). This may
explain the absence of behavioral outcomes in the Go/Nogo task, sug-
gesting that brain-related effects were not sufficient to see changes in
behavioral cold EFs, but instead translated into changes in hot EFs. If
this is true, our results point toward brain changes in the cool EF sys-
tem that may support behavioral changes in hot EF, important for daily
life situations and crucial in high-risk contexts for children.
The present study used a longitudinal design with an active con-
trol group, which allows us to draw conclusions about causality and
control the non-specific effects, confirming that the reported effects
are related to the training of mindfulness per se. Additionally, the use
of multiple levels of measurements (questionnaires, behavioral tasks,
electrophysiological recordings) and several informants (children and
teachers) allow us to draw stronger conclusions. Despite this, our study
is limited since only one school was part of the study making difficult
to generalize the results. The sample size is a common challenge and
limitation of the field of EEG studies with children, where a high num-
ber of participants are expected to be eliminated due to eye and/or
head movements that cannot be corrected. Therefore, it is likely that
the most restless children are not included in the final samples of EEG
studies. Future work should replicate our study with an increased num-
ber of participants and schools. Also, longer interventions would be
useful to determine the time-line effects of mindfulness on EFs in high-
risk contexts. Lastly, we did not have a follow-up measurement due
to the difficulties of collecting EEG data and did not include parents,
teachers, and the school community in the interventions, limiting the
sustainability of the improvements obtained.
To conclude, children from vulnerable contexts who participate
in a school-based mindfulness intervention displayed improved exec-
utive functioning, inhibitory control and attention at the reported
and behavioral level, which was accompanied by increased Nogo P3
amplitude, compared to an active control group. Together, our results
showed that mindfulness trainings in schools improve EFs and partic-
ularly inhibitory control in high-risk children, providing them crucial
abilities for a healthier development and preventing future problems.
We hope this research will help advance the science and practice
of school mindfulness-based preventive interventions that will help
vulnerable children flourish.
