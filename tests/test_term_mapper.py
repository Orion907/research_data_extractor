        Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affects approximately 463 million adults worldwide.
        This randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of metformin versus placebo in 
        newly diagnosed patients. The primary outcome was hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reduction.
        
        Methods: We enrolled 240 patients (mean age 58.3 ¬± 12.4 years, 52% female) with T2DM.
        Inclusion criteria included HbA1c ‚â• 7.0% and body mass index (BMI) 25-40 kg/m¬≤.
        Participants were randomized to metformin 1000mg twice daily or placebo for 12 weeks.

        Results: At baseline, mean HbA1c was 8.2% ¬± 1.1%. After 12 weeks, the metformin group
        showed significant reduction in HbA1c compared to placebo (7.1% vs 8.0%, p < 0.001).
        Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) decreased from 156 mg/dL to 124 mg/dL in the treatment group.
        
        Adverse events occurred in 23% of metformin patients versus 15% of placebo patients.
        Most common side effects were gastrointestinal: nausea (12%), diarrhea (8%), abdominal pain (5%).

        Conclusion: Metformin demonstrates superior glycemic control compared to placebo in
        treatment-naive T2DM patients. The drug was generally well-tolerated with expected
        gastrointestinal side effects. These findings support metformin as first-line therapy
        for newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with elevated HbA1c levels.
